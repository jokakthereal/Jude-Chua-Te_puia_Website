                Te Puia spans 70 hectares within the historic Te Whakarewarewa 
                Geothermal Valley, on the edge of Rotorua. We are home to the 
                world famous Pōhutu geyser, mud pools, hot springs and silica 
                formations. You will also find the native Kiwi bird and the 
                national schools of wood carving, weaving, stone and bone 
                carving. We have shared these taonga (treasures) with manuhiri 
                (visitors) for over 170 years and proudly continue that 
                tradition today.
                <br>
                Te Puia’s Qualmark Gold Status shows that Te Puia has been 
                independently validated as a tourism business of the very 
                highest quality. The Qualmark seal of approval tells visitors 
                from around the world that the tourism experience they will 
                have at Te Puia will be exceptional, safe and environmentally 
                sustainable.
                <br>
                The values of manaakitanga (hospitality) and kaitiakitanga 
                (guardianship) underpin everything that we do at Te Puia. Our 
                world-famous guiding tradition shows our regard for treating 
                visitors with respect and making them part of our whānau 
                (family). Our commitment to kaitiakitanga means that we will 
                protect the rich natural and cultural taonga (treasures) at 
                Te Puia and ensure that they thrive for generations to come.
