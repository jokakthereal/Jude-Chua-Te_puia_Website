                In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began
                 the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors.
                  Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man who would 
                  become master carver of the institute today.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the 
                national carving school, under the guidance of those, such as 
                Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who 
                were once institute carving students themselves.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away traditional 
                Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our 
                National Carving School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of 
                Authenticity. We also accept carving commissions.

                <h1 class="experience-txt-hdng">Pohutu Geyser</h1>
                <p class="experience-txt-right">
                    Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” 
                    and erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is 
                    semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after another 
                    of our active geysers. According to Maori culture, geysers 
                    are viewed as gifts from the gods.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the 
                    “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince 
                    Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was 
                    traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 
                    10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and 
                    reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 feet).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the 
                    blackened crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped 
                    jet can reach heights of up to 15 metres (just over 49 
                    feet). It is named after the New Zealand Pigeon.

                    <p class="experience-txt-left">
                        The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that 
                        cause the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form 
                        a clay called kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but 
                        finely divided black sulphur turns it to grey. This mud 
                        pool is also known as the “Frog Pool” because of the 
                        similarity between the plopping mud and leaping frogs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that 
                        are used to treat skin, rheumatic and arthritic 
                        ailments. Māori traditionally used the mud to treat 
                        stomach infections by mixing a small amount with water 
                        and drinking it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That “pongy” smell Rotorua is famous for is due to 
                        hydrogen sulphide released by geothermal features. 
                        When released into the air, the hydrogen sulphide 
                        reacts with oxygen, creating sulphuric acid. This acid 
                        has the ability to dissolve rock into fine particles of 
                        silica and clay, and when combined with a small supply 
                        of water, a mud pool is created.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Rotorua Thermal Mud used in face masks and other 
                        beauty products is sourced from mud pools about ten 
                        times the size of Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud Pool. You can 
                        purchase some of these products from Te Puia’s Gift 
                        Shop.
